When thinking about a way to trigger the analog sensor, I was looking at the arduino toolbox and found the ultrasonic sensor. It looks interesting to me so I search online and found it "uses sonar to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do". So I think it might be fun to play around with that. To learn how to use ultrasonic sensor, I went to the arduino website. My first step is to make the analog sensor work, And then figure out where to add my digital sensor.

I learned how to turn on the LEDs with variation of distance between my hand to the sensor. It seems like I made a traffic light. When my hand is within 10 cm from the sensor, these three LEDs turn on automatically.

The second question will be where to add my digital sensor. I put a switch between three LEDs. But all of them stopped working at the same time so I took off the other two and focus on one. I thought maybe it's becasue

I draw a schematic as following:
