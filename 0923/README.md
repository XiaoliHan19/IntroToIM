I was inspired by eucalyptus and want to make a work about it. So in this assignment I create a class -- click wherever you want, and a leave of random green-ish color and of random round-ish shape will appear. This way, every time you will make a different eucalyptus plant.

I had fun experimenting different combinations of colors until making it the way I like. I wanted to create a picture full of leaves - but then I found it ungly so I cut down the number of leaves. I also like how it produces more interactions with users by letting them decide where to put the leaves. Since everytime it's a different picture, and people mostly just clicked intuitively, the work has more randomness.

And I did struggle a bit becasue at first I want to represent the leaves by drawing two curves. It actually complicated the code. But I still kept them just to remind myself of my thinking process.
