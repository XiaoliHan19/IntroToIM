**FINAL PROJECT**
-------

*11/30 [1st CONCEPT]*

For the final project I want to make an installation that use human fingers as keyboard. I want to make gloves with jumpwires attached to each finger. The other end of the wire will be connected to the arduino, corresponding with a certain music note. The music notes range from C, D, E, F......to C, D, E. 10 keys correspond to 10 fingers. To make this human instrument work, only by pressing the same finger will connect the circuit and the respective key note will pop up. On the processing end, the screen will provide hint on what the next music key should be. This whole thing needs the cooperation between two people. My intention is using human as agency to connect arduino and processing. What's more, it encouraged more interpersonal interactions.

*12/06 [FINAL CONCEPT]*

I gave up the idea of making a human instrument becasue to enable people to move their fingers freely while staying connected with arduino I need to soldering really long wires. And the workload for soldering 20 long wires is huge. What's more, I was worried that it wouldn't be strong enough. On the other hand, becasue there are too many wires attached to the gloves, participants might not able to move their hands freely anyway. If they move their fingers back and forth, the wires might become entangled. To sum up, this idea might not be feasible to put into practice.

So I came up with a new idea of making a karaoke machine. You will have to choose a picture out of three. After that, it will assign you a song that you can sing. The processing end will show the pictures and karaoke videos (output). To flip pages and make choices, you can push the assigned buttons on the arduino breadboard (input).  

*12/10 [CODES ON PROCESSING AND ARDUINO DONE]*

Processing codes basically aim to create pretty and consistent interface. For arduino,as long as I pushed different buttons and they lead me to different pages then I'm golden. Not too many problems have been encountered during this process. The only thing that took up some times is I didn't use the right arduino code for serial communication. I changed from "DigitalReadSerial" to "QuickRead". So when I pressed a button on breadboard, it sends signal of certain value to processing and it triggered to turn pages. Another mistake was that for different push buttons, their serial.write() should be different for each button but I wrote the same value for all of them.

*12/12 [Microphone Problem]*

At first, I borrowed two Electret Microphone Breakouts from IM Lab and hoped to create handmade microphones out of them. But I didn't know how. I consulted with Professor Shiloh and decided to borrow microphone from equipment center and connect them with the speaker in IM Lab and then to processing. However, I was told the speaker is for guitar and is not compatible with microphone. It is also hard to borrow professional speakers and microphone since I'm not enrolled in any music classes. I searched online and found out many people use their phone as microphone. Once connecting the phone with bluetooth speaker and re-set up the input and output in computer system, I can sing to my phone and hear it from the speaker. Nevertheless, the biggest drawback is an apparent latency. Even connecting the two with USB cable cannot solve the problem. While during user testing, some people think this latency is fun. I don't understand. But I decided to keep it and see how people react to that. If they don't like it, I'll change the output to headphone. To each participant they can hear special sound effect through the headphone. But it's not fun to watch for others.

*12/13 [Add In More Songs]*

During user testing, a friend suggested I can put more songs by adding a page. That said, after choosing a picture it will ask particpant to choose again. This way, I can have 3x3=9 songs. I added one more button and redesigned the function of each button. I have to assign different function to them everytime to prevent overlapping (for example if: 1⃣️. the currentPage = 1; val = 3; currentPage = 2. and 2⃣️. the currentPage = 2; val = 3; currentPage = 4. THEN as I push the button it will skip page 2 and directly jump to page 4).

I also changed my song list becasue they overlap with D2 songs too much.
