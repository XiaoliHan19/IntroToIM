FINAL PROJECT
-------------------------------
**Karaoke Machine**

Once pressing a digital sensor on the arduino breadboard, it writes certain value and will be sent to processing, triggering it to flip pages. Below is a schematics of my circuits.

**Risks, Complicatedness & Unknown**

As I mentioned in the journal, the microphone is the biggest problem in my project. I cannot find the compatible mic to the speaker. And after switching to bluetooth speaker, there is always latency. 

During end of semester show, I got to collect some ideas from people. Some people enjoyed the karaoke. We sang together and had so much fun. Some people are shy and didn't want to use the microphone. Some people don't know the songs. Some people only finished the first half of the song and did not want to proceed. I asked two people regarding to this problem. One mentioned she wanted it to give scores after singing each line so she will be more motivated. Another person thought the karaoke can be more interactive. For example, I can add more functions to keep people hooked.
