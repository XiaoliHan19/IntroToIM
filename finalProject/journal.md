**1. Concept**

11/30 [1st CONCEPT]

For the final project I want to make an installation that use human fingers as keyboard. I want to make gloves with jumpwires attached to each finger. The other end of the wire will be connected to the arduino, corresponding with a certain music note. The music notes range from C, D, E, F......to C, D, E. 10 keys correspond to 10 fingers. To make this human instrument work, only by pressing the same finger will connect the circuit and the respective key note will pop up. On the processing end, the screen will provide hint on what the next music key should be. This whole thing needs the cooperation between two people. My intention is using human as agency to connect arduino and processing. What's more, it encouraged more interpersonal interactions.

12/06 [FINAL CONCEPT]

I gave up the idea of making a human instrument becasue to enable people to move their fingers freely while staying connected with arduino I need to soldering really long wires. And the workload for soldering 20 long wires is huge. What's more, I was worried that it wouldn't be strong enough. On the other hand, becasue there are too many wires attached to the gloves, participants might not able to move their hands freely anyway. If they move their fingers back and forth, the wires might become entangled. To sum up, this idea might not be feasible to put into practice.
