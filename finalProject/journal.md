**FINAL PROJECT**
-------
**1. Concept**

I want to make a drawing game for a group of 3-4 people. First, everyone closed their eyes but the drawer of the session who can see the prompt (a simple object or an abstract idea). After 5 seconds, the word disappears and the drawer will start to draw on the canvas, aka the processing page, using sensor in arduino. Other players will have to guess what the word/object is by looking at the drawing. The winner will get 100 points. After a round of game, we will decide who's the winner.
