**Unusual Switch**

For this assignment, I was inspired when trying to take one tea bag from the tea box -- as if losing balance, the rest of tea bags slipped and fell. In my work, 
before taking any tea bag, the switch is on so is the blue light becasue two ends of the wire are clinging together; after taking one tea bag out, the rest falls so the two ends separate. The switch is off and yellow light is on. By looking at the color of the LED light, one can tell if any tea bag is taken. As for the materials, I went to IM Lab to pick up some copper tapes. But as they are harder to fold around the wire, I changed to use aluminum foil instead.

*Challenge*
I ended up spent more time debugging than building my circuit. One of the biggest challenge I had is that in the beginning only the yellow light is on, meaning the switch is. I first considered the possibility that if my materials were not conductive enough. So I wrapped them with more aluminum foil. But the switch is still not on.
