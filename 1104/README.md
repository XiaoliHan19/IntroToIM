**Unusual Switch**

For this assignment, I was inspired when trying to take one tea bag from the tea box -- as if losing balance, the rest of tea bags slipped and fell. In my work, 
before taking any tea bag, the switch is on so is the blue light becasue two ends of the wire are clinging together; after taking one tea bag out, the rest falls so the two ends separate. The switch is off and yellow light is on. By looking at the color of the LED light, one can tell if any tea bag is taken.
