I really like the idea of the musical instrument so in this assignment I want to make a piano. You can view the keyboards on Processing and play them on arduino. I used a potentiometer and a button here, so you can select the keys by turning the potentiometer, and press the keys by pushing the digital switch (button). 

First, I drew a schematics for the piano:


Below is a picture of the keyboard on processing:
