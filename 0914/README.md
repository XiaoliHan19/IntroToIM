At first, I want to create a design of sea wave lapping against the beach. However, my skills did not match my thoughts ---- the sea waves ended up looking quite ugly, so I gave up on that idea and got rid of the semi-circles. My final version consists of a moon and my imaginary sea wave: I was exploring different functions and thinking this one might share some similarities with the waves. I still need to practice more, and also it'd be better to have a more concrete idea before making
any works.
